Indeed, modifying the name of temporary files is not quite possible, as far as I've seen.

However, I think we can automatically achieve this through our PowerShell automation support.

Here's what I'm thinking:

- we load the project using the PowerShell automation support

- we get the ProductVersion from the file

- we then rename the file that we want to add as temporary file to contain the version

- we add the temporary file to the project and build it

Here would be the script:

# create the AI com obj
$advinst = new-object -comObject AdvancedInstaller

# load the project
$project = $advinst.LoadProject("C:\Users\Catalin\Desktop\Your Application.aip")

# get the Product Version
$prodVersion = $project.ProductDetails.Version

# get the path to the file that we want to add as Temporary (in my case, this is on Desktop)
$desktop = [Environment]::GetFolderPath("Desktop")
$originalFileName = "test.txt"
$newFileName = "test $prodVersion.txt"

# create the full file paths for new and old
$originalFilePath = join-path $desktop $originalFileName
$newFilePath = join-path $desktop $newFileName

# rename the file
rename-item -path $originalFilePath -newName $newFileName

$newFilePath

# add the file into AI as temporary
$tempFile = $project.TempFilesComponent.AddFile($newFilePath)

$project.Save()


I have added comments for each line.

Other than this, you could add the file as a regular file and have the [ProductVersion] property appended to the name.

Hope this helps!
